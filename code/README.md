## Structure of the code

#### Reusing previous code

This paper reuses some of the code (e.g. for preparing the data) and results (e.g. for other methods) from the LDpred2 paper, which you can view at https://github.com/privefl/paper-ldpred2/tree/master/code.


#### Added code in this paper

- `run-lassosum2`: run lassosum2 for the 8 real traits

- `plot-res-lassosum`: Figure 1

- `run-simu-misspecify-N`: Running all methods in the simulations with GWAS sample size misspecification + Figures S1 and S2

- `test-lassosum2-auto`: Figure S3
