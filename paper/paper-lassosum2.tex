\section*{Code and results availability}

All code used for this paper is available at \url{https://github.com/privefl/paper-lassosum2/tree/master/code}.
We have extensively used R packages bigstatsr and bigsnpr \cite[]{prive2017efficient} for analyzing large genetic data, packages from the future framework \cite[]{bengtsson2020unifying} for easy scheduling and parallelization of analyses on the HPC cluster, and packages from the tidyverse suite \cite[]{wickham2019welcome} for shaping and visualizing results.
We have also used R package deming for fitting Deming regressions.

R packages bigstatsr and bigsnpr can be installed from GitHub and CRAN.
A tutorial on fitting penalized regressions with R package bigstatsr is available at \url{https://privefl.github.io/bigstatsr/articles/penalized-regressions.html}.
A tutorial on running LDpred2 with R package bigsnpr is available at \url{https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/LDpred2.html}.
